# Time-Perception-Oddball-Task-Experiments

These experiments are designed using MATLAB 2012 and PsychToolBox, PTB-3

The four experiments are as the files are named.

1. Stationary standards with expanding oddball.

2. Expanding standards with stationary oddball

3. Stationary circular standards with stationary circular, different colored oddball.

4. Stationary circular standards with stationary square oddball.

Following variables contain the information extracted.

1. seconds: The response time after the screen has turned gray.

2. keyPressed: Takes either 0 or 1. 0 for shorter duration (when key 's' is pressed) and 1 for longer duration (when key 'n' is pressed)

3. inputForValue: Corresponding test duration for each keypress. 

The code stays in a loop till either 'l' or 's' are pressed at the gray screen.
